# Dijkstras-algorithm
Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest distances between cities

# Menu
1. Print City Info - User enter a city code and program 
will print out the city information (the whole record).
2. Find the connection between two cities - Get two city codes as input from the
user and find the shortest distance between two cities.
3. Insert a road (edge) between two cities - the user will be asked to enter the
two city codes and its distance.  
  ○ Note: that if a pair of city codes already exists or if the city code doesn't
exist, warning message will be printed.
4. Delete a road (edge): the user will be asked to enter two city codes for this road.  
  ○ Note: That if the road entered doesn't exist, warning message will be printed.
5. Exit: Exit the program
